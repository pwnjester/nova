        <h3>Caesar Cipher</h3>
        <p>The Caesar cipher is one of the oldest and simplest forms of encryption. Named after Julius Caesar, who reportedly used it in his private correspondence, this cipher works by shifting each letter of the alphabet a fixed number of places. For example, with a shift of 3, "A" becomes "D," "B" becomes "E," and so on. To decode a message, you simply shift the letters back by the same amount. While easy to use, the Caesar cipher is also easy to crack, especially with modern tools.</p>

        <h3>Morse Code</h3>
        <p>Morse code encodes text into sequences of dots (short signals) and dashes (long signals). Each letter and number has a unique combination. For example, "A" is ".-" and "B" is "-...". Morse code was widely used in early telecommunication, especially via telegraph. While it's not encryption in the traditional sense, it is a way of encoding language into another form that needs to be decoded for understanding. <a href="https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html">Here</a> is a morse code translator.</p>

        <h3>Base64 Encoding</h3>
        <p>Base64 is a method used mainly in computing to encode binary data into ASCII text. It works by converting data into a set of 64 characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and a couple of symbols. This is useful for transmitting data over text-based systems, like email. Base64 is a reversible transformation. You can try your hand at Base64 encoding <a href="https://www.base64decode.org">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Pigpen Cipher</h3>
        <p>The Pigpen cipher uses symbols instead of letters and is based on a grid or “pigpen” structure. Each symbol corresponds to a letter of the alphabet, and it often looks like a series of lines and dots. It was used by the Freemasons and appears secretive to those unfamiliar with the pattern. Decoding involves matching symbols back to their place on the pigpen grid.</p>

        <h3>Binary Code</h3>
        <p>Binary encoding is the language of computers. It uses only two digits—0 and 1—to represent data. Each letter, number, or symbol is assigned a binary value (e.g., "A" is 01000001 in ASCII). Decoding binary involves translating these sequences back into human-readable text using a binary-to-text <a href="https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/ascii-to-binary.html">converter</a> or chart. It’s foundational for all modern computing systems.</p>

        <h3>EXIF Data</h3>
        <p>EXIF data, although not necessarily a cipher or code, is hidden information stored in image files, especially those taken with digital cameras or smartphones. This data can include details like the date and time the photo was taken, camera settings, GPS location, and even the device model. Some people hide messages in EXIF fields by editing them manually, using them as a discreet form of steganography.</p>

      <h2>Encoding in Audio</h2>

      <div class="topic">
        <h3>Spectrogram Images</h3>
        <p>A spectrogram is a visual representation of the frequencies present in an audio file over time. Encoding information into a spectrogram involves turning text or images into sound so that they appear visually when the audio is viewed in a spectrogram viewer. This is done using a website like <a href="https://nsspot.herokuapp.com/imagetoaudio/">this one</a>, which converts brightness to volume and vertical position to pitch. For example, you can write a phrase like "HELLO WORLD" in an image editor, convert it to audio, and the resulting sound will contain those words encoded in its frequency pattern. The audio often sounds like static or buzzing, but when opened in a spectrogram tool, the hidden text or image becomes visible.</p>

        <h3>Frequency Modulation (Ultrasonic Messages)</h3>
        <p>Some audio files can hide messages in frequencies outside the normal range of human hearing—either too high (ultrasound) or too low (infrasound). These hidden frequencies can carry encoded signals that are detectable only by machines or special audio analysis tools.</p>

        <h3>Backmasking</h3>
        <p>Backmasking involves recording a message normally, then reversing it and inserting it into a track so that the message is heard only when the audio is played backward. It has been used intentionally in music as a hidden joke or eerie secret and was famously associated with conspiracy theories in the 1970s and 80s.</p>
